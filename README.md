# Deficit CNN

## About
This project explores the application of a convolutional neural network
in classifying the data of a
[human aging model](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.032302)
to predict mortality. I have been working on this project in
[Dr. Andrew Rutenberg](http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~adr/index.php?TreeIndex=0)'s lab.
This repo was made public on July 29, 2019.

The execution of the CNN tests was made possible by Compute Canada's
[Graham](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham) cluster.
