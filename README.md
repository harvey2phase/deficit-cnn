# Deficit CNN

## About and Acknowledgment
This is an ongoing project exploring the application of a convolutional neural
network (CNN) in classifying the data of a
[human aging model](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.032302)
to predict mortality. I have been working on this project with
[Dr. Andrew Rutenberg](http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~adr/index.php?TreeIndex=0).
This repo was made public on July 29, 2019.

The execution of the CNN tests was made possible by Compute Canada's
[Graham](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Graham) cluster.

MORE DETAIL AND DOCUMENTATION TO COME.



## Preliminary Results

### Binary Classification
Can the CNN predict whether a model individual will reach mortality in 5 years
at age 80? Does the accurcy of the predict improve given more history of 
individuals' health trajectory?
